CHM 548 PROGRAMMING HOMEWORK 2

(1) Use the program from HW1 to compute the Franck–Condon factors, I_n, between two displaced Morse potentials.

(2) Verify numerically that the wave packet, |w(0)> , created on the electronic excited state’s potential immediately after the
transition is identical to |v_0>.

(3) Calculate and plot the wave packet, |w(t)> , as a function of time t, using the sum-over-state formula.
                                            
(4) Calculate and plot the correlation function.

(5) Fourier transform the correlation function and reproduce the Franck–Condon factors.

(6) Calculate and plot the wave packet, |w(t)> , as a function of time t, by integrating the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
